# How to Audit Your LinkedIn Profile: The Complete Guide for Founders

Your LinkedIn profile isn't a resume — it's a landing page. And like any landing page, it either converts or it doesn't.

Most founders treat LinkedIn as an afterthought. They slap together a headline, copy-paste their bio, and wonder why inbound leads never materialize. The truth is, a well-optimized LinkedIn profile can be your most powerful growth channel — but only if you know what to fix.

This guide walks you through a complete **LinkedIn profile audit**, section by section, with a scoring framework you can apply today.

## Why a LinkedIn Profile Audit Matters

LinkedIn has over 1 billion members. But the platform's algorithm heavily favors profiles that are complete, keyword-rich, and actively engaged. A half-finished profile doesn't just look bad — it's actively suppressed by LinkedIn's search algorithm.

Here's what a proper LinkedIn profile review reveals:

- **Search visibility gaps** — Are you showing up when prospects search for your expertise?
- **Conversion blockers** — Does your profile convince visitors to connect, follow, or reach out?
- **Trust signals** — Do you look credible at first glance?
- **Content alignment** — Does your profile match the audience you're trying to attract?

## The 8-Point LinkedIn Profile Audit Framework

### 1. Profile Photo (Score: 0-10)

Your photo is the first thing people see. LinkedIn data shows profiles with professional photos get **21x more views** and **36x more messages**.

**What to check:**
- High resolution (400x400 minimum)
- Face takes up 60-70% of the frame
- Good lighting, clean background
- Approachable expression (slight smile works best)
- Consistent with your brand (casual founder vs. corporate exec)

**Common mistakes:** Group photos cropped awkwardly, logos instead of faces, photos from 10 years ago, sunglasses.

### 2. Banner Image (Score: 0-10)

The banner is free billboard space that most people waste. It should reinforce your value proposition or brand.

**What to check:**
- Custom banner (not the default LinkedIn blue)
- Includes a clear value proposition or tagline
- Your company name or website URL
- Proper dimensions (1584x396 pixels)
- Mobile-friendly (key text isn't cut off on phones)

### 3. Headline (Score: 0-15)

Your headline is the most important SEO element on your profile. It appears in search results, connection requests, comments, and posts.

**What to check:**
- Goes beyond just your job title
- Includes keywords your audience searches for
- Communicates the outcome you deliver
- Under 220 characters (the visible limit)

**Strong formula:** \`[Role] | Helping [audience] achieve [outcome] through [method]\`

**Example:** "CEO at CloudSync | Helping SaaS founders reduce churn by 40% with predictive analytics"

**Common mistakes:** Just "CEO" or "Founder." No keywords. Trying to be clever instead of clear.

### 4. About Section (Score: 0-15)

Your About section is your pitch. The first 3 lines are visible without clicking "see more," so they must hook the reader.

**What to check:**
- Opens with a compelling hook (not "I am a passionate...")
- Written in first person
- Clearly states who you help and how
- Includes relevant keywords naturally
- Has a call-to-action (DM me, visit our site, book a call)
- 3-5 short paragraphs (not a wall of text)

### 5. Featured Section (Score: 0-10)

The Featured section is prime real estate that sits right below your About. Use it to showcase your best work.

**What to check:**
- Has at least 2-3 featured items
- Includes a lead magnet, case study, or landing page
- Top-performing posts are pinned
- Links have custom thumbnails (not auto-generated previews)

### 6. Experience Section (Score: 0-15)

Don't just list job titles. Each role should tell a story about impact.

**What to check:**
- Current role has a detailed description
- Descriptions focus on outcomes, not responsibilities
- Includes metrics where possible (grew revenue 3x, hired team of 20)
- Company pages are linked (creates a logo next to the role)
- No unexplained gaps

### 7. Skills & Endorsements (Score: 0-10)

Skills are a direct ranking factor in LinkedIn search. The right skills help you appear in recruiter and prospect searches.

**What to check:**
- At least 10 relevant skills listed
- Top 3 skills match your target keywords
- Skills are endorsed by credible connections
- Irrelevant skills are removed

### 8. Activity & Content (Score: 0-15)

A great profile without activity is like a beautiful store with no customers inside. Social proof matters.

**What to check:**
- Posted or engaged in the last 7 days
- Content aligns with your professional brand
- Mix of original posts, comments, and shares
- Engagement rate above 2% (more on this in our [engagement rate guide](/blog/linkedin-engagement-rate-benchmarks))

## Scoring Your Profile

Add up your scores across all 8 categories. Here's what your total means:

| Score | Rating | What It Means |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| 80-100 | Excellent | Your profile is a growth engine. Focus on content. |
| 60-79 | Good | Strong foundation. A few optimizations will unlock more reach. |
| 40-59 | Needs Work | You're leaving significant opportunities on the table. |
| Below 40 | Critical | Your profile may be hurting your brand. Prioritize a full overhaul. |

## The 5 Most Common LinkedIn Profile Mistakes

1. **Generic headline** — "Entrepreneur | Innovator | Thought Leader" tells nobody anything useful.
2. **No About section** — 40% of LinkedIn profiles have an empty or one-line About section. This is the biggest missed opportunity.
3. **Resume-style experience** — "Responsible for managing a team" vs. "Built and led a 15-person engineering team that shipped 3 products in 12 months." Night and day.
4. **Ignoring the Featured section** — Free real estate that most founders leave completely empty.
5. **Zero activity** — A stale profile signals that you're not engaged in your industry.

# LinkedIn Engagement Rate: What's Good and How to Improve It

You posted on LinkedIn. You got 12 likes and 3 comments. Is that good? Bad? Average?

Without understanding **LinkedIn engagement rates**, you're flying blind. You can't improve what you can't measure, and you can't benchmark without knowing what "good" looks like.

This guide covers everything: how to calculate your LinkedIn engagement rate, what benchmarks to aim for based on your follower count, and 10 proven tactics to improve your numbers.

## How to Calculate LinkedIn Engagement Rate

The standard LinkedIn engagement rate formula is:

**Engagement Rate = (Reactions + Comments + Shares + Clicks) ÷ Impressions × 100**

Some people calculate it against follower count instead of impressions:

**Engagement Rate (by followers) = (Reactions + Comments + Shares) ÷ Followers × 100**

Both are valid, but the **impressions-based formula** is more accurate because it measures how engaging your content is to the people who actually saw it. The follower-based formula is easier to calculate since you always know your follower count.

### Why Impressions-Based Is Better

If you have 10,000 followers but a post only reaches 2,000 people, calculating engagement against 10,000 gives you an artificially low rate. The impressions-based calculation tells you how compelling your content was to the audience that actually encountered it.

LinkedIn shows impressions on every post (in creator mode or via analytics), so there's no reason not to use this method.

## LinkedIn Engagement Rate Benchmarks

Here's what "good" looks like on LinkedIn in 2026, broken down by follower tier:

### By Follower Count (Engagement Rate by Impressions)

**Under 1,000 followers:**
- Below average: < 3%
- Average: 3-6%
- Good: 6-10%
- Excellent: 10%+

**1,000 – 5,000 followers:**
- Below average: < 2%
- Average: 2-4%
- Good: 4-7%
- Excellent: 7%+

**5,000 – 20,000 followers:**
- Below average: < 1.5%
- Average: 1.5-3%
- Good: 3-5%
- Excellent: 5%+

**20,000 – 100,000 followers:**
- Below average: < 1%
- Average: 1-2.5%
- Good: 2.5-4%
- Excellent: 4%+

**100,000+ followers:**
- Below average: < 0.5%
- Average: 0.5-1.5%
- Good: 1.5-3%
- Excellent: 3%+

### Why Engagement Rate Drops With More Followers

This is natural and expected. As your audience grows, a smaller percentage of followers see each post (LinkedIn doesn't show your content to all followers). Larger accounts also attract more passive followers who rarely engage. Don't panic if your rate decreases as you grow — focus on absolute engagement numbers alongside the rate.

## What Counts as "Engagement" on LinkedIn?

Not all engagement is equal. Here's the hierarchy of value:

1. **Comments** — Most valuable. Comments signal deep engagement and trigger the algorithm to show your post to more people.
2. **Shares/Reposts** — Extends your reach to new audiences.
3. **Reactions** (Like, Celebrate, Love, Insightful, Funny, Support) — Quick signal of appreciation. "Insightful" carries slightly more weight with the algorithm than a basic "Like."
4. **Clicks** — Profile clicks, link clicks, "see more" clicks. Indicates interest but doesn't boost distribution as much.
5. **Follows from post** — The ultimate engagement. Someone found your content valuable enough to want more.

### Dwell Time Matters Too

LinkedIn also tracks how long people spend reading your post. A 2-minute read signals higher quality than a 3-second scroll-past. This is why long-form text posts often outperform short ones — they accumulate dwell time.

## 10 Tactics to Improve Your LinkedIn Engagement Rate

### 1. Write Stronger Hooks

The first 2 lines of your post determine whether someone clicks "see more." Your hook must create curiosity, promise value, or make a bold claim.

**Weak hook:** "Today I want to share some thoughts about leadership."

**Strong hooks:**
- "I fired our best salesperson. Here's why it was the right call."
- "3 years ago, I was $200K in debt. Last month, my startup crossed $5M ARR."
- "Stop saying 'I'm passionate about X' on LinkedIn. Here's what to say instead."

### 2. Post at Peak Hours

LinkedIn engagement peaks during business hours. The best times to post:

- **Tuesday through Thursday**, 8-10 AM in your audience's time zone
- **Tuesday** is generally the highest-engagement day
- Avoid weekends and Monday mornings (people are catching up)

### 3. End With a Question

Posts that end with a genuine question get **2-3x more comments** than those that don't. The question should be easy to answer and relevant to the post.

**Examples:**
- "What's the best career advice you've ever received?"
- "Do you agree, or am I completely off base?"
- "Which of these resonates most with your experience?"

### 4. Use Line Breaks Aggressively

Walls of text die on LinkedIn. Use short paragraphs (1-2 sentences max), line breaks between thoughts, and white space to make your content scannable.

### 5. Reply to Every Comment Within the First Hour

The first 60 minutes after posting are critical. LinkedIn's algorithm watches early engagement velocity. Reply to every comment quickly — it doubles the comment count (your replies count too) and encourages more people to join the conversation.

### 6. Engage Before You Post

Spend 15-20 minutes commenting on other people's posts before publishing yours. This warms up your profile in the algorithm and puts you on people's radar, making them more likely to see and engage with your post.

### 7. Use Carousels for Educational Content

LinkedIn carousel posts (PDF documents) consistently generate the highest engagement rates because:
- They keep people swiping (high dwell time)
- Each slide is a micro-hook
- They're saved and shared more than text posts

### 8. Tell Stories, Not Lectures

Personal stories outperform generic advice by 3-5x on LinkedIn. People connect with humans, not bullet points. Frame your insights within a narrative: what happened, what you learned, what the reader can take away.

### 9. Be Consistent (But Don't Burn Out)

Posting 3-5 times per week is the sweet spot for most founders. Less than twice a week and the algorithm forgets you exist. More than once a day and you're competing against yourself.

### 10. Analyze and Iterate

Track which posts perform best and double down on those formats and topics. Look for patterns in your top-performing content:
- What format was it? (text, carousel, video, poll)
- What topic category?
- What time did you post?
- How strong was the hook?

## How GrowthLens Tracks Your Engagement Rate

Manually calculating engagement rates across dozens of posts is tedious. **GrowthLens** automatically tracks your LinkedIn engagement metrics and shows you:

- **Your average engagement rate** over time
- **Benchmarks** against others in your follower tier
- **Top-performing content** patterns
- **Best posting times** based on your actual data
- **Engagement trend lines** — are you improving or declining?

Instead of guessing whether your engagement is "good," you get a clear picture with data-driven recommendations.

## The Engagement Rate Trap

One final note: don't optimize purely for engagement rate. A post that gets 500 likes from random people is less valuable than a post that gets 20 comments from your ideal customers.

**Quality of engagement matters more than quantity.** Focus on reaching the right people with content that demonstrates your expertise. The engagement will follow.

# LinkedIn Content Strategy for Founders: Post Types That Actually Work

Most founders approach LinkedIn content like throwing spaghetti at a wall. They post sporadically, switch formats randomly, and abandon the platform after two weeks of mediocre results.

The founders who actually build an audience and generate leads from LinkedIn do something different: they follow a **content strategy**. Not a rigid editorial calendar, but a clear framework for what to post, how to post it, and how often.

This guide gives you that framework, backed by data on what actually performs on LinkedIn in 2026.

## The 4 LinkedIn Post Types (Ranked by Performance)

### 1. Carousel Posts (PDF Documents) — Highest Engagement

**Average engagement rate: 3-5x higher than text posts**

Carousel posts are LinkedIn's engagement kings. Users swipe through slides, accumulating dwell time that the algorithm loves. They're also highly saveable and shareable.

**Best for:**
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Frameworks and methodologies
- Before/after comparisons
- Data visualizations
- Listicles (10 lessons, 7 mistakes, etc.)

**Tips for better carousels:**
- First slide = thumbnail. Make it bold with a clear title.
- 8-12 slides is the sweet spot
- One idea per slide
- Use large, readable fonts (people browse on mobile)
- Last slide = CTA (follow for more, comment your thoughts, visit link)
- Export as PDF from Canva, Google Slides, or Figma

**Why they work:** Carousels hack the algorithm through dwell time. Each swipe signals engagement. A 10-slide carousel where someone reads all slides counts as significantly more engagement than a text post someone scrolls past in 2 seconds.

### 2. Text-Only Posts — Most Versatile

**Average engagement rate: Baseline (other formats measured against this)**

Text posts are the bread and butter of LinkedIn. They're the fastest to create and, when written well, can match or beat carousels in reach.

**Best for:**
- Personal stories and lessons learned
- Hot takes and contrarian opinions
- Quick tips and observations
- Behind-the-scenes founder updates
- Engagement-bait questions (use sparingly)

**Optimal length:** 800-1,300 characters (roughly 150-250 words). Long enough to provide value, short enough to be consumed quickly. Posts that require clicking "see more" actually perform well because the click signals engagement.

**The hook is everything.** The first 2 lines must stop the scroll. More on hooks below.

### 3. Video Posts — Highest Reach Potential

**Average engagement rate: Variable (high ceiling, low floor)**

LinkedIn is pushing video content hard. Native video posts get a significant reach boost, but only if people actually watch them.

**Best for:**
- Talking-head insights (60-90 seconds)
- Product demos
- Event clips and behind-the-scenes
- Customer testimonials
- Industry news reactions

**Tips for better video:**
- First 3 seconds must hook (no logo intros)
- Add captions (85% watch without sound)
- Vertical or square format (mobile-first)
- Keep under 2 minutes for best completion rates
- Upload natively (don't paste YouTube links — LinkedIn suppresses external links)

**The catch:** Video requires more production effort, and bad video performs worse than good text. Start with text, graduate to video once you have a content rhythm.

### 4. Polls — Easy Engagement, Low Value

**Average engagement rate: High (but declining)**

Polls generate easy engagement because voting requires zero effort. However, LinkedIn has been reducing poll distribution after they were overused for engagement farming.

**Best for:**
- Market research (genuinely curious about audience preferences)
- Starting conversations on polarizing topics
- Gauging interest in a product or feature
- Breaking up your content mix

**Use sparingly:** Once every 2-3 weeks maximum. Polls that feel like engagement bait (e.g., "Do you agree that hard work matters? 👍/👎") will hurt your credibility.

### Bonus: Document Posts, Newsletters, Articles

- **LinkedIn Articles:** Long-form content (1,000+ words). Lower immediate reach than posts, but good for SEO and establishing authority. Best for evergreen thought leadership.
- **Newsletters:** LinkedIn's newsletter feature gives you direct subscriber notifications. Powerful for building a dedicated audience. Requires Creator Mode.
- **Image Posts:** Lower engagement than carousels but useful for infographics, screenshots of tweets or data, and memes (yes, LinkedIn memes work for certain audiences).

## The Hook Formula: 5 Patterns That Stop the Scroll

Your hook is the most important part of any LinkedIn post. Here are 5 proven patterns:

### Pattern 1: The Contrarian Take
"Everyone says you need a morning routine. I disagree. Here's why my best work happens at midnight."

### Pattern 2: The Unexpected Result
"We removed our pricing page. Revenue went up 35%."

### Pattern 3: The Vulnerable Admission
"I've been a CEO for 7 years. I still feel like an imposter every Monday morning."

### Pattern 4: The Specific Number
"I analyzed 847 LinkedIn posts. Here are the 3 patterns that get 10x more engagement."

### Pattern 5: The Before/After
"2 years ago, I had 200 LinkedIn followers and zero inbound leads. Last month, I closed $180K from LinkedIn alone. Here's exactly what changed."

**The key principle:** Your hook should create a gap between what the reader expects and what you're about to reveal. That gap creates curiosity, and curiosity creates clicks.

## Posting Frequency: How Often Should Founders Post?

### The Data-Backed Sweet Spot

**3-5 posts per week** is optimal for most founders. Here's why:

- **1 post/week:** Not enough to build momentum. The algorithm needs consistent signals.
- **2 posts/week:** Minimum viable frequency. You'll grow slowly but steadily.
- **3-5 posts/week:** The sweet spot. Enough to stay top-of-mind without burning out.
- **Daily (7/week):** Aggressive but effective if you can maintain quality. Risk of your posts competing against each other.
- **Multiple posts/day:** Diminishing returns. Your second post often cannibalizes the first.

### When to Post

The best posting times on LinkedIn in 2026:

- **Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday:** Peak days
- **8:00-10:00 AM** in your audience's time zone: Highest engagement window
- **12:00-1:00 PM:** Secondary peak (lunch break scrolling)
- **Avoid:** Friday afternoons, weekends (unless your audience is international)

Post at the same time consistently. This trains the algorithm and your audience to expect your content.

## Content Pillars: The Framework That Prevents Burnout

A content pillar system prevents the "what should I post today?" paralysis. Choose 3-5 pillars and rotate between them.

### Recommended Content Pillars for Founders

**Pillar 1: Industry Expertise**
Share insights, trends, data, and analysis from your domain. This builds authority.
- "Here's what our data shows about [trend]"
- "3 things most people get wrong about [topic]"
- Hot takes on industry news

**Pillar 2: Founder Journey**
Behind-the-scenes of building your company. This builds connection.
- Wins and milestones
- Failures and lessons learned
- Hiring, culture, decision-making stories

**Pillar 3: Actionable Tips**
Tactical, immediately useful advice your audience can apply. This builds trust.
- How-to posts and frameworks
- Templates and checklists
- Tool recommendations

**Pillar 4: Social Proof**
Customer stories, results, case studies. This builds credibility.
- Customer wins (with permission)
- Product updates tied to outcomes
- Testimonials and reviews

**Pillar 5: Personal/Human**
Non-business content that shows you're a real person. This builds likability.
- Book recommendations
- Weekend activities
- Opinions on non-controversial topics
- Family and personal milestones (use judgment)

### Weekly Content Calendar Example

- **Monday:** Industry insight (Pillar 1)
- **Tuesday:** Founder story (Pillar 2)
- **Wednesday:** Actionable tip — carousel (Pillar 3)
- **Thursday:** Customer win or social proof (Pillar 4)
- **Friday:** Personal/human post (Pillar 5)

You don't need to follow this rigidly. The point is having a framework so you never stare at a blank screen.

## Measuring What Works

After 30 days of consistent posting, analyze your performance:

1. **Which pillar gets the most engagement?** Double down on it.
2. **Which format performs best for you?** (It varies by creator.)
3. **Which hooks generated the most "see more" clicks?**
4. **What time of day works best for your specific audience?**
5. **Are you attracting the right people?** (Check who's commenting — are they potential customers?)

**[Get your free LinkedIn content audit →](/)** — Understand what's working, what's not, and exactly what to change.

## Start Simple, Stay Consistent

The biggest mistake founders make with LinkedIn content isn't posting the wrong type of content — it's not posting consistently. A mediocre post published every Tuesday beats a brilliant post published once a quarter.

Start with text posts (lowest effort, highest learning speed). Experiment with carousels once you're comfortable. Add video when you're ready for production work.

The most important thing? **Start this week.**

# The 2026 LinkedIn Profile Optimization Checklist: 15 Things Top Founders Do Differently

We've audited hundreds of LinkedIn profiles through GrowthLens. After studying the data, a clear pattern emerges: the founders who actually generate inbound leads and speaking invitations from LinkedIn aren't doing anything magical. They're just doing 15 things that most people skip.

This isn't a generic "complete your profile" guide. These are the specific, high-leverage optimizations that separate a profile generating 10 inbound leads per month from one generating zero.

## The Checklist

### 1. Your Headline Follows the Value Formula

❌ "CEO at TechCorp"
✅ "CEO at TechCorp | Helping B2B teams cut onboarding time by 60% | Ex-Google"

The **value formula**: Role + Who you help + Specific outcome + Credibility signal

Your headline appears everywhere on LinkedIn — search results, comments, connection requests, post attribution. It's your most visible piece of copy. Yet 72% of founders we've audited use nothing more than their job title.

**The test**: Would a stranger reading only your headline understand what value you provide? If the answer is no, rewrite it.

**Pro tip**: Include 2-3 keywords your target audience searches for. LinkedIn's search is essentially headline-weighted.

### 2. Your Banner Tells a Story

The default LinkedIn banner is a blue gradient that says "I haven't thought about my profile in years." Your banner should communicate one of three things:

- **Your value proposition** (what you help people achieve)
- **Social proof** (featured in Forbes, 10K+ customers, award-winning)
- **A clear CTA** (join the newsletter, book a call, visit the site)

**Dimensions**: 1584 × 396 pixels. Design it in Canva in 10 minutes. This is the lowest-effort, highest-impact change you can make.

### 3. Your About Section Opens With a Hook, Not a Bio

The first 3 lines of your About section are visible without clicking "see more." These 300 characters are prime real estate.

❌ "I am a passionate entrepreneur with over 15 years of experience in the technology sector..."

✅ "Most B2B companies lose 40% of new users in the first week. We fixed that. At TechCorp, we've helped 200+ companies cut onboarding churn in half — without adding a single extra step to the signup flow."

**The structure that works**:
1. **Hook** — a surprising stat, bold claim, or relatable pain point (lines 1-2)
2. **What you do** — specific, outcome-focused (lines 3-5)
3. **Proof** — numbers, customers, results (lines 6-8)
4. **Call to action** — what should someone do next? (last 2 lines)

Write it in first person. Nobody wants to read a third-person corporate bio on a personal profile.

### 4. Your Featured Section Has a Lead Magnet

The Featured section sits directly below your About — it's the highest-converting real estate on your profile. Top founders use it to capture leads.

**What to pin**:
- A free resource (guide, template, checklist) with an email gate
- Your best-performing LinkedIn post (social proof)
- A case study or customer success story
- A link to book a call

**What NOT to pin**: Your company's generic website homepage. That converts nobody.

### 5. Your Experience Section Reads Like a Case Study

Each role should answer: "What did you build, and what happened because of it?"

❌ "Responsible for overseeing marketing operations and managing a team of 12."

✅ "Built the marketing engine from 0 → $4M pipeline in 18 months. Grew the team from 2 to 12. Launched the company's first content program, generating 40% of all inbound leads."

**Use numbers wherever possible.** Revenue, team size, growth percentages, users, anything measurable. Numbers create credibility and stop the scan.

### 6. You Post at Least 3 Times Per Week

A perfect profile with zero activity is like a beautiful restaurant with no reviews. People won't trust it.

LinkedIn's algorithm rewards consistency. Our data shows a clear inflection point at **3 posts per week** — below that, your content reaches a fraction of your network. Above that, diminishing returns kick in.

The sweet spot: **3-5 posts per week**, at consistent times.

### 7. Your Content Has a Clear Pillar System

Top founders don't post randomly. They rotate between 3-5 content pillars:

1. **Expertise** — insights from your domain that position you as an authority
2. **Founder stories** — behind-the-scenes of building the company
3. **Tactical advice** — actionable tips your audience can use immediately
4. **Social proof** — customer wins, metrics, testimonials
5. **Personal** — the human side that makes you relatable

When we audit content through GrowthLens, we classify every post by pillar. The founders with the highest engagement have a clear, deliberate mix — not a random stream of thoughts.

### 8. Your Hooks Are Specific, Not Generic

The first 2 lines of any LinkedIn post determine its success. We analyzed hook patterns across hundreds of posts:

**Hooks that work**:
- Specific numbers: "I spent $47,000 on LinkedIn ads last quarter. Here's what actually worked."
- Contrarian takes: "Cold outreach is dead. Here's what replaced it."
- Vulnerable admissions: "We lost our biggest customer last month. It was my fault."
- Before/after: "12 months ago, 0 followers. Today, 15K. Here's every step."

**Hooks that flop**:
- "I've been thinking about..." (nobody cares what you've been thinking)
- "Excited to announce..." (unless it's genuinely exciting)
- "Here are my thoughts on..." (just share the thoughts, skip the preamble)

### 9. You Reply to Every Comment in the First Hour

The first 60 minutes after posting are critical. LinkedIn's algorithm measures early engagement velocity — how quickly people react to your content.

Replying to every comment does three things:
- Doubles your comment count (your replies count)
- Signals to the algorithm that there's a conversation happening
- Encourages lurkers to join in

**Set a timer.** Post, then spend the next 60 minutes engaging.

### 10. Your Engagement Rate Is Above 2%

If you're posting regularly and your engagement rate is below 2%, something is off. Common culprits:

- **Wrong audience** — your followers don't match your content topics
- **Weak hooks** — people scroll past without reading
- **No CTAs** — you're not inviting interaction
- **Posting at bad times** — your audience isn't online

GrowthLens calculates your engagement rate using median per-post metrics (not mean) to avoid viral outlier skew. This gives you a more accurate picture of your typical performance.

### 11. You Use Carousels for Educational Content

Carousel posts (PDF uploads) consistently outperform text posts by 3-5x in engagement rate. They're especially effective for:

- Frameworks and step-by-step processes
- Data visualizations
- Before/after comparisons
- Listicles (7 mistakes, 10 tips, etc.)

**The key**: One idea per slide, large readable text, strong first slide (it's your thumbnail).

### 12. Your Profile Photo Is Recent and Professional

This seems basic, but 15% of founder profiles we audit have one of these problems:
- Photo is 5+ years old
- Cropped from a group photo
- Selfie with bad lighting
- Logo instead of a face
- No photo at all

Invest in a professional headshot. It costs $100-200 and lasts years. Alternatively, take one yourself: natural light, clean background, face forward, slight smile.

### 13. You Have 500+ Connections in Your Target Market

LinkedIn's algorithm initially shows your content to your 1st-degree connections. If those connections aren't in your target market, your content reaches the wrong people.

**Action**: Spend 15 minutes a week sending targeted connection requests to people in your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile). Personalize the request with one specific reason you want to connect.

### 14. You Engage on Others' Content Before You Post

Spending 15-20 minutes commenting thoughtfully on other people's posts before publishing yours does two things:

1. Warms up your profile in the algorithm
2. Puts you on people's radar, making them more likely to engage with your post

This is the most underrated LinkedIn growth tactic. It costs nothing but attention.

### 15. You Audit Your Profile Quarterly

Your LinkedIn profile should evolve with your business. What worked 6 months ago might not work today. Set a quarterly reminder to review:

- Is your headline still accurate?
- Does your About section reflect your current focus?
- Are your Featured items still relevant?
- Has your content strategy shifted?

## Score Yourself

Count how many of these 15 items you're doing well:

| Score | Rating | What It Means |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| 13-15 | Elite | You're in the top 5% of LinkedIn founders |
| 10-12 | Strong | A few tweaks will unlock significantly more reach |
| 7-9 | Average | You're leaving real opportunities on the table |
| 4-6 | Weak | Your profile is likely hurting more than helping |
| 0-3 | Critical | Time for a complete overhaul |

## Get Your Score Automatically

Don't want to self-assess? **GrowthLens** audits your LinkedIn profile across all these dimensions automatically and gives you a precise score with specific, prioritized recommendations.

# GrowthLens vs Shield Analytics: Which LinkedIn Tool Is Right for You?

If you're serious about growing on LinkedIn, you've probably searched for tools to help you understand what's working and what's not. Two names that come up frequently are **GrowthLens** and **Shield Analytics**.

But here's the thing — they're not really competitors. They solve different problems, at different price points, for different stages of your LinkedIn journey. This guide gives you an honest, side-by-side comparison so you can decide which one (or both) makes sense for you.

## What Is Shield Analytics?

Shield Analytics is a paid LinkedIn analytics platform that's been around since 2019. It connects to your LinkedIn account via OAuth and continuously tracks your content performance, audience growth, and engagement metrics over time.

**Shield's core offering:**
- Historical analytics dashboard with trend lines
- Content performance tracking across all your posts
- Audience demographics and growth metrics
- Content calendar and scheduling features
- Team analytics for companies managing multiple LinkedIn accounts
- CSV data exports for custom reporting

Shield starts at **$15/month** for individual creators and scales up to $100+/month for team plans. It requires you to connect your LinkedIn account directly, granting it access to your profile data.

## What Is GrowthLens?

GrowthLens is a **free LinkedIn profile audit tool** designed for founders and professionals who want an instant assessment of their LinkedIn presence. Instead of ongoing tracking, GrowthLens provides a point-in-time audit with a detailed scorecard and actionable recommendations.

**GrowthLens's core offering:**
- Instant LinkedIn profile audit (no login required)
- Scoring framework across multiple profile dimensions
- Actionable, prioritized recommendations
- Profile comparison tool (benchmark against others)
- Content and engagement analysis
- Completely free — no paid tiers, no credit card

The key difference? You don't need to connect your LinkedIn account. Just paste a LinkedIn URL and get your results in under 60 seconds.

## Feature-by-Feature Comparison

### Pricing

| | GrowthLens | Shield Analytics |
|---|---|---|
| **Cost** | Free | $15/month+ |
| **Free trial** | N/A (always free) | 10-day free trial |
| **Team plans** | Not applicable | $100+/month |

This is the most obvious difference. GrowthLens is completely free with no hidden upsells or premium tiers. Shield is a subscription product that costs at least $180/year for an individual plan.

For founders just getting started on LinkedIn or those who want a quick audit without committing to a monthly expense, GrowthLens is the clear choice on price alone.

### LinkedIn Login Requirement

**GrowthLens: No login required.** Paste any public LinkedIn URL and get an instant audit. You can even analyze competitors' profiles without them knowing.

**Shield: Requires LinkedIn OAuth connection.** You must authorize Shield to access your LinkedIn data. While Shield has a solid privacy track record, some users are uncomfortable granting third-party access to their LinkedIn accounts — especially after LinkedIn's history of API changes that have broken third-party tools.

This is a significant differentiator. GrowthLens's no-login approach means zero friction, zero privacy concerns, and the ability to audit anyone's profile — not just your own.

### Profile Auditing and Scoring

**GrowthLens: Purpose-built for auditing.** GrowthLens evaluates your profile across multiple dimensions — headline optimization, about section quality, content engagement, visual branding, and more — and assigns a clear score with specific recommendations ranked by impact.

**Shield: No audit or scoring framework.** Shield tracks your analytics over time but doesn't tell you *what to fix*. It shows you that your engagement rate is 2.3%, but it won't tell you that your headline is costing you search visibility or that your About section needs a stronger hook.

If you want to know *what's wrong* with your profile and *how to fix it*, GrowthLens is built specifically for that. Shield assumes you already know what to optimize and just need the data.

### Historical Analytics and Trends

**Shield: Excellent.** This is Shield's superpower. Once connected, it tracks every post, every engagement metric, every follower gained — indefinitely. You can see trends over weeks, months, and years. You can identify which content formats perform best, track audience growth velocity, and spot engagement patterns over time.

**GrowthLens: Point-in-time analysis.** GrowthLens gives you a snapshot of your current LinkedIn presence. It's not designed for ongoing historical tracking. You can re-run audits periodically to see improvement, but it doesn't maintain a continuous data stream.

For creators who post multiple times per week and want to deeply understand their content performance trends, Shield's historical analytics are genuinely valuable and something GrowthLens doesn't try to replicate.

### Content Calendar and Scheduling

**Shield: Available on higher-tier plans.** Shield offers content calendar features that let you plan and organize your LinkedIn posting schedule. This is useful for teams and creators who batch-create content.

**GrowthLens: Not a scheduling tool.** GrowthLens focuses on auditing and recommendations, not content management. For scheduling, you'd pair GrowthLens with a dedicated tool like Buffer or Taplio.

### Team and Multi-Account Features

**Shield: Built for teams.** Shield's team plans let agencies and companies track multiple LinkedIn accounts from a single dashboard. If you're managing LinkedIn for a team of executives or running a personal branding agency, Shield's team features are a genuine differentiator.

**GrowthLens: Individual-focused.** GrowthLens is designed for individual founders and professionals auditing their own profiles (or sizing up competitors). It doesn't have multi-seat team management.

### Profile Comparison

**GrowthLens: Built-in comparison tool.** One of GrowthLens's unique features is the ability to compare two LinkedIn profiles side-by-side. Want to see how your profile stacks up against a competitor or industry leader? Paste both URLs and get a detailed comparison with specific areas where you're ahead or behind.

**Shield: Limited comparison.** Shield focuses on your own data. You can't easily benchmark your profile against a competitor's.

### Speed and Simplicity

**GrowthLens: 60 seconds from URL to results.** No signup, no OAuth dance, no waiting for data to populate. Paste a URL, get your audit. It's designed for speed.

**Shield: Setup required.** You need to create an account, connect your LinkedIn, and wait for Shield to backfill your historical data. Once set up, the dashboard is powerful — but the initial time investment is higher.

## When to Use GrowthLens

GrowthLens is the right choice when you:

- **Want a quick LinkedIn audit** without committing to a subscription
- **Don't want to connect your LinkedIn account** to a third-party tool
- **Need actionable recommendations** on what to fix, prioritized by impact
- **Want to compare your profile** against competitors or industry benchmarks
- **Are early in your LinkedIn journey** and need a roadmap before investing in paid tools
- **Want to audit someone else's profile** — a new hire, a client, a competitor
- **Have zero budget** for LinkedIn tools but still want data-driven insights

GrowthLens is particularly powerful as a **starting point**. Run the audit, implement the recommendations, then decide if you need ongoing analytics.

## When to Use Shield Analytics

Shield is the right choice when you:

- **Post consistently** (3-5x/week) and want to track content performance over time
- **Need historical trend data** to identify what's working month over month
- **Manage multiple LinkedIn accounts** for a team or agency
- **Want a content calendar** integrated with your analytics
- **Have the budget** and want a dedicated LinkedIn analytics dashboard
- **Need CSV exports** for client reporting or internal reviews

Shield is a power tool for serious LinkedIn creators who are past the optimization stage and deep into the content execution stage.

## Can You Use Both?

Absolutely — and that's actually the ideal approach for many founders.

**Start with GrowthLens** to get your baseline audit, understand what's broken, and implement the high-impact fixes. This costs nothing and takes 60 seconds.

**Graduate to Shield** once you're posting consistently and need ongoing performance tracking. At that point, the $15/month investment makes sense because you have enough content data to make the analytics meaningful.

Think of it this way: GrowthLens is your **LinkedIn doctor** — it diagnoses problems and prescribes fixes. Shield is your **LinkedIn fitness tracker** — it monitors your ongoing health metrics once you're in shape.

## The Verdict

There's no single "better" tool here — it depends entirely on where you are and what you need.

**Choose GrowthLens if** you want a free, instant, no-login-required profile audit with specific recommendations to improve. It's the best starting point for anyone who hasn't optimized their LinkedIn presence yet.

**Choose Shield if** you're already an active LinkedIn creator who needs deep, historical content analytics and team management features. It's worth the investment once you're posting regularly.

**Choose both if** you want the best of both worlds — periodic audits from GrowthLens to catch optimization gaps, plus ongoing tracking from Shield to measure your content performance.

# GrowthLens vs AuthoredUp: Free Audit vs Full Writing Suite

Choosing the right LinkedIn tool depends on where you are in your journey. Are you trying to **figure out what's wrong** with your LinkedIn presence, or are you ready to **produce content at scale**?

GrowthLens and AuthoredUp attack different parts of the LinkedIn growth problem. This comparison helps you understand which one you actually need — and whether you need both.

## What Is AuthoredUp?

AuthoredUp is a **LinkedIn content creation and analytics platform** built for consistent creators. It's a Chrome extension and web app that enhances your LinkedIn writing workflow.

**AuthoredUp's core features:**
- Rich text editor with formatting (bold, italic, lists) for LinkedIn posts
- Post templates and snippet library
- Draft management — write, save, and organize post ideas
- Analytics dashboard tracking post performance over time

AuthoredUp costs **$19.95/month** (billed annually) or $24.95 month-to-month. It requires a Chrome browser and LinkedIn account connection.

GrowthLens is a **free LinkedIn profile audit tool** that gives you an instant scorecard of your entire LinkedIn presence. No account needed, no Chrome extension, no LinkedIn login.

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Feature | GrowthLens | AuthoredUp |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| **Price** | Free | $19.95/mo |
| **Profile audit** | ✅ Detailed scorecard | ❌ No audit feature |
| **Content writing** | ❌ Not a writing tool | ✅ Rich text editor |
| **Post analytics** | ✅ Engagement analysis | ✅ Full analytics dashboard |
| **Comparisons** | ✅ Side-by-side profiles | ❌ No comparison feature |
| **Scheduling** | ❌ No scheduling | ✅ Content calendar |
| **Setup required** | None — paste a URL | Chrome extension install |
| **LinkedIn login** | Not required | Required |
| **Templates** | ❌ | ✅ Template library |
| **Draft management** | ❌ | ✅ Save and organize drafts |

## When to Use GrowthLens

**You should start with GrowthLens if:**

- You're not sure what's wrong with your LinkedIn presence
- You want a quick diagnostic before investing in tools
- You want to compare your profile against competitors or peers
- You're a founder who needs to know: "Is my LinkedIn working?"
- You want a free, zero-commitment starting point

GrowthLens answers the question: **"Where do I stand, and what should I fix first?"**

Think of it like a doctor's checkup. Before you start a fitness routine (content creation), you should know your baseline health metrics. That's GrowthLens.

## When to Use AuthoredUp

**AuthoredUp makes sense if:**

- You already know your profile is solid and you're focused on content output
- You post on LinkedIn 3+ times per week and need workflow tools
- You want to build a library of templates and reusable snippets
- You need rich text formatting that LinkedIn's native editor doesn't support
- You want to plan content weeks in advance with a calendar view

AuthoredUp answers the question: **"How do I create better content, faster?"**

It's a production tool for serious, consistent LinkedIn creators.

## Can You Use Both?

Absolutely — and it's actually the ideal workflow:

1. **Start with GrowthLens** — Run a free audit to understand your current LinkedIn score, identify weak spots, and get prioritized recommendations
2. **Fix your profile** — Use GrowthLens's section-by-section feedback to optimize your headline, about section, and featured content
3. **Start creating with AuthoredUp** — Once your profile is optimized (so visitors actually convert), use AuthoredUp to produce content consistently
4. **Re-audit periodically** — Come back to GrowthLens monthly to track how your score improves as you implement changes

This sequence matters. Creating great content with AuthoredUp won't help much if your profile itself turns visitors away. Fix the foundation first.

## The Bottom Line

**GrowthLens** is for **diagnosis** — understanding where you are and what to fix. It's free and instant.

**AuthoredUp** is for **production** — creating content at scale once you know your profile is solid. It's a paid tool for committed creators.

Most founders should start with GrowthLens (free, takes 60 seconds) and graduate to AuthoredUp when they're ready to commit to a consistent content schedule.
